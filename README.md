This repository contains a number of script's relating to Mitiga's "Abusing the Amazon Web Services SSM Agent as a Remote Access Trojan" blog post.
  
Note that the scripts under `scripts/run_another_ssm_agent_scenario` should not be executed by `sh [filename]`, but rather manually in the interactive shell.
